  about: `
Hey, I’m Divyansh Singh Parihar — a Full Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer who loves building things that actually help people.

I recently interned at Religare Housing Finance, where I built an internal entitlement review system that cut down manual review efforts by over 60%. I also integrated secure authentication (LDAP), automated emails, and handled production deployment — it gave me a solid taste of building real-world systems at scale.

Beyond that, I’ve worked on projects like ThesisOne, an AI-powered slide generator used by 100+ users, and an AI code documentation tool that turns GitHub repos into clean, exportable docs — cutting doc work by up to 80%.

I’m also the creator of StudyPal, a peer-matching platform for students that made it to the finals of RIDE Hackathon 2023, and an Obfuscated Malware Detector that uses explainable ML to catch threats from raw memory dumps.


I care about building tools that are fast, meaningful, and easy to use. Outside of work, I love exploring new tech and turning side projects into something real.

Let’s connect — I’m always up for solving interesting problems or just chatting about cool ideas.
